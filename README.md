- 👋 Hi, I’m @AutoKitsune aka Mark Fox.  I have another GitHub ID for my car-related stuff (is that allowed?) but...
- 👀 I’m interested in weird use-cases and giving things names that are probably not necessary: like 'intranet-of-things', and trying to create a uC field-oriented-control board for sub-miniature 3-phase motors that is under 1 cubic centimetre in volume.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning just about everything, for I am old(er), experienced, and smart, but like Jon Snow, I know nothing.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on...  er... anything and nothing. I do what I do. If you like that and want to ask, ask. If you think I can help you, ask.
- 📫 How to reach me: message me here.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him/"oi you, twattybollocks".
- ⚡ Fun fact: I constantly use pop-culture references inappropriately. I never walk into a place I don't know how to walk out of.
